# py-minesweeper

This is a classic minesweeper written in Python by Daniel Nautré
it feature most of the classic game play feature and is fully playable.

It is meant as an exercise for me to get back into programming

I'm happy to hear suggestion, as this is supposed to be an exercice, I welcome any critics. 

I'm not planning to turn this into anything more than a exercice, there are plenty of good minesweeper out there that are better than mine. But I don't mind if you use it either. 

Have Fun !
